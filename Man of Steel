<a href="http://www.legendary.com/films/man-of-steel/">"It's not an S. On my world it means Hope." </a><p></p>  This is one of my favorite lines that was said in the movie "Man of Steel". I like this quote because It made me think deeply about what was said and the meaning that could be behind why it was said.To most people it [S] just looked like a regular S.However to those who had an understanding, they saw a completely different meaning, Hope.Therefore stating hope can be hidden in plain sight due to misdirection. It may seem to be something else or something that is so familiar and so common that you forget that it can represent Hope in your life.<p></p><iframe	width="420" height="345"src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/v=HnbPbkFUCPs"></iframe>
